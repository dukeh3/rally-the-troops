Crusader Rex: Implementation Notes</h1>

<p>
How do I designate the Main Attack?
<p>
The first block that moves into an enemy area defines the main attack road.
Any other blocks who enter the battle from the same road also count as being part of the main attack.
<p>
Likewise, the first block that moves to reinforce a battle started by player one defines the main reinforcement.
<p>
The main attack, main reinforcement, and secondary reinforcement moves are noted in the game log with *, &#x2020;, and &#x2021; respectively.
