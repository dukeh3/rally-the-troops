<p>
From the end of the American Revolution, commercial vessels of the young United
States republic were easy prey for the pirates of the Barbary coast. In 1801,
newly inaugurated President Thomas Jefferson was eager to put an end to this
threat and sent a "squadron of observation" to the Mediterranean. As the
squadron arrived in Gibraltar, they learned that the bashaw of Tripoli had
already declared WAR!

<p>
The Shores of Tripoli plays out this exciting episode of Early American
military history. As the United States, one player will pressure Tripolitania
to allow the free movement of American merchant vessels - or face the
consequences. As the bashaw of Tripoli, the other player will continue the
lucrative piracy of the fearsome corsairs while countering the American threat
on land and sea.
