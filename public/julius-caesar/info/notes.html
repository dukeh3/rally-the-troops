Julius Caesar: Implementation Notes</h1>

<p>
How do I designate the attacking main force?
<p>
The first block that moves into a contested area defines the main force. Any other blocks
who enter the battle from the same road also count as being part of the main force.
The attacking main force move is marked with an asterisk in the game log.

<p>
What happens when Cleopatra would be eliminated by Vulcan and switches side, and there are other enemy blocks in the same location?
<p>
Cleopatra switches sides and counts as the attacking main force.
The battle is resolved in the normal battle phase.
