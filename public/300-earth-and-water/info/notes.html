<hr>

<p>
Some rules clarifications:

<ul>
<li>Attacker retreating by sea from land battle brings all fleets with them.
<li>Defender can't retreat by sea to controlled port if enemy fleets are there.
<li>Lines of communication cannot be traced to an enemy controlled major city.
</ul>

<hr>
<p>
Can Persian supply attrition be taken from armies in Abydos or Ephesus
in order to leave a large stack in greece for the next campaign?
<p>
No. Persian supply attrition can only be taken from armies in Greece.

<hr>
<p>
Can Themistocles be used to transport armies?
<p>
No, because this is a reaction move and the armies would stay at sea. This is not allowed.

<hr>
<p>
Who plays next after Molon Labe is played for a Greek land movement?
<p>
This is a reaction card played during the Persian Turn. The Greek player turn is next (to move, play an event or pass).

<hr>
<p>
If the "Sudden Death" is drawn and both Darius and Xerxes are already dead, is
the operation phase still canceled?
<p>
No.

<hr>
<p>
When during the turn can Pausanias be played?
<p>
Before the first round of combat.

<hr>
<p>
If I want to attack with the bonus from Miltiades, do I need to play another card to move first?
<p>
Yes. The Miltiades card is a reaction event. It can be played as a reaction to your own move, or during your opponent's turn.

<hr>
<p>
Must an attacker take the shortest road, or can they take a circuitous route in order to retreat
to a city other than the one they came from?
<p>
This implementation assumes you took the shortest path if you started adjacent to the battle.
