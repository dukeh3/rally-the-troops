Richard the Third is an epic two-player wargame that recreates the 15th
century, bloody dynastic struggle between the royal houses of Lancaster and
York for the throne of England. Will the mad-king Henry VI and his Queen
Margaret keep the throne or will the Duke of York recover it for the
Plantagenets. Also strutting across the game's stage are Edward IV, Richard
III, Henry VII, and Warwick, the notorious "Kingmaker".

<p>
The object of play is to eliminate all five enemy heirs and/or win control of
the powerful nobles of England. The Lancastrians start the game holding the
throne, and the Yorkists are in exile ready to invade. Kingship can be won or
lost several times during the game. Will Richard III emerge triumphant, or will
he perish in battle as he did historically?
