=============

1) New fight!

Defender deploys (main forces only) in castle and/or field. -- see example on page 5

// -- ERROR: reserve blocks moving into same area? --
// If all withdraw and no reinforcements are coming, attacker may regroup.
// Regroup into other existing siege -- arrive as reinforcements.
// If any attacker blocks stay, goto existing siege.

If any defenders stay, goto field battle.
Else goto siege.

2) Field battle!

Defender may withdraw into castle as combat action.

If defender is eliminated and there are blocks in the castle, goto existing siege.

Else regroup.

6.56 timing

	new siege:
		2 frank in town
		3 saracen attack main road
		1 saracen attack secondary road
		2 frank reinforce main
		1 frank reinforce secondary


			round 1: 2 frank vs 3 saracen
			round 2: 2+2 frank vs 3+1 saracen
			round 3: 2+2+1 frank vs 3+1 saracen
	
	old siege:
		2 p1 in castle
		2 p2 in field
		1 p1 attack main road (relief)
		1 p1 attack second road
		1 p2 reinforce main road
		1 p2 reinforce second road

		round 1: 2+1 p1 vs 2 p2
		round 2: 2+1 p1 vs 2+1 p2
		round 3: 2+1+1 p1 vs 2+1+1 p2

	old siege #2:
		2 p1 in field
		2 p2 in castle
		p1 pass
		1 p2 reinforce main road (relief)
		1 p2 reinforce second road

		round 1: 2 p1 vs 2 p2 -or- 2 p1 vs 2+1 p2?
		-- I believe the rules clarification missed this case --
